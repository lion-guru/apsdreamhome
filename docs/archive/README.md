# Documentation Archive Plan

Use this folder to park milestone summaries and historical reports that are no longer part of day-to-day documentation but should remain accessible for reference.

## Candidate Files to Move

- `*_COMPLETE.md`
- `*_STATUS.md`
- `*_SUMMARY.md`
- `DEEP_PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md`
- `DEEP_SCAN_REPORT.md`
- `FINAL_*` transformation summaries
- Any deprecated module guide superseded by current docs

## Migration Guidelines

1. Ensure the key insights from the document are reflected in an active guide before moving it here.
2. Add an entry to this file (or a dedicated index) noting what was archived and when.
3. Preserve original filenames for traceability; prepend with the date if helpful (e.g., `2025-11-11_COMPLETE_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`).
4. If a document contains sensitive information, review and sanitize before archiving.

## Follow-up

- Update the root `README.md` and `docs/README.md` once files are relocated so links remain accurate.
- Periodically review the archive to decide if older artifacts can be removed entirely.
