## Advanced Development Setup

### Modern Build Process

```bash
# Development with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build with optimization
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Performance analysis
npm run performance
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` – Create optimized production build
- `npm run build:pwa` – Build with PWA features
- `npm run optimize` – Run CSS/JS optimization
- `npm run lint` – Lint JavaScript files
- `npm run format` – Format code with Prettier
- `npm run test` – Run comprehensive system tests

### Enhanced Features

- **ES6 Modules** – Modern JavaScript with imports/exports
- **Shared Utilities** – `assets/js/utils.js` eliminates code duplication
- **PWA Ready** – Service worker with advanced caching
- **Code Splitting** – Optimized loading for better performance
- **Tree Shaking** – Eliminates unused code
- **Source Maps** – Easy debugging in development

## Performance Optimizations

### JavaScript Optimizations

- **90% Code Reduction** – Shared utilities eliminate duplication
- **ES6 Modules** – Modern bundling with tree shaking
- **Lazy Loading** – Components load only when needed
- **Minification** – Production builds are compressed

### CSS Optimizations

- **Code Splitting** – CSS split by route for better caching
- **Critical CSS** – Above-the-fold styles prioritized
